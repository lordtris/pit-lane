<!--VITE PLUS START-->

# Using Vite+, the Unified Toolchain for the Web

This project is using Vite+, a unified toolchain built on top of Vite, Rolldown, Vitest, tsdown, Oxlint, Oxfmt, and Vite Task. Vite+ wraps runtime management, package management, and frontend tooling in a single global CLI called `vp`. Vite+ is distinct from Vite, and it invokes Vite through `vp dev` and `vp build`. Run `vp help` to print a list of commands and `vp <command> --help` for information about a specific command.

Docs are local at `node_modules/vite-plus/docs` or online at https://viteplus.dev/guide/.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Run `vp install` after pulling remote changes and before getting started.
- [ ] Run `vp check` and `vp test` to format, lint, type check and test changes.
- [ ] Check if there are `vite.config.ts` tasks or `package.json` scripts necessary for validation, run via `vp run <script>`.
- [ ] If setup, runtime, or package-manager behavior looks wrong, run `vp env doctor` and include its output when asking for help.

# Git Workflow

## Branch Protection

**`main` is protected at both levels:**

- **Remote** — GitHub ruleset blocks direct pushes to `main`. All changes require a pull request.
- **Local** — Pre-commit hook blocks commits on `main`/`master`. Error message tells you to create a feature branch.

## Process

1. **Create a feature branch** from `main` before any implementation:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/description
   ```
2. **Make changes, commit, push** to your feature branch.
3. **Open a pull request** to `main` on GitHub.
4. **Merge via PR** — never push or merge directly to `main`.

## Branch naming

- `feat/description` — new features
- `fix/description` — bug fixes
- `chore/description` — tooling, config, dependencies
- `docs/description` — documentation

## Git Safety Constraints

### Never bypass hooks

- NEVER use `--no-verify` on any git push or commit.
- If a pre-push hook fails, the hook is telling you something. Fix the root cause.
- If the hook is failing on files you didn't change, that is a tooling issue — surface it to the user. Do not bypass the hook.
- Setting `HUSKY=0` or `VITE_GIT_HOOKS=0` to skip hooks is equivalent to `--no-verify` and is equally prohibited.

### Sequential PR workflow

When submitting multiple PRs that depend on each other:

1. Rebase ONE branch onto `origin/main`.
2. Run `vp install` to regenerate the lockfile.
3. Run `vp check` and `vp test` locally.
4. Push. Open PR. Wait for CI to pass.
5. Merge the PR.
6. Pull main locally (`git pull --ff-only origin main`).
7. Rebase the NEXT branch onto the updated main.
8. Repeat from step 2.

NEVER rebase multiple branches in the same operation.
NEVER rebase onto a feature branch — always rebase onto `origin/main`.
NEVER force-push a branch that has an open PR without explicit user approval.

### Stop-and-surface on failure

When CI fails, a test breaks, or a hook blocks:

1. STOP. Do not immediately attempt a fix.
2. Read the actual error output. Quote it.
3. Identify the root cause by examining evidence (CI logs, lockfile, config).
4. If the root cause is in code you wrote: fix it, verify locally, push.
5. If the root cause is in code you did NOT write, or in tooling/config, or if you are unsure: surface it to the user with your diagnosis. Do NOT make changes to working commits without explicit approval.

NEVER treat a symptom (e.g., "add zod to package.json") as a root cause fix.
NEVER make changes to commits that have already been reviewed and approved without explicit user approval.

### PR troubleshooting

If a PR's status check is not associating or CI is not triggering:

1. Check if the branch is behind main. If so, rebase onto main.
2. Check if the required status checks are configured in GitHub branch protection.
3. If both are correct, wait 60 seconds and refresh — GitHub status association can lag.

NEVER create empty commits to "trigger CI."
NEVER close and reopen a PR to "refresh" status checks.
NEVER delete and re-push a branch as a troubleshooting step.

<!--Kaparthy Rules-->

# Karpathy Guidelines 12 Rules

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes, derived from [Andrej Karpathy's observations](https://x.com/karpathy/status/2015883857489522876) on LLM coding pitfalls.

These rules apply to every task in this project unless explicitly overridden.
**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:

- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

<!-- Extended Rules -->

## 5. Use the model only for judgment calls

Use Claude for: classification, drafting, summarization, extraction from unstructured text.
Do NOT use Claude for: routing, retries, status-code handling, deterministic transforms.
If a status code already answers the question, plain code answers the question.

## 6. Token budgets are not advisory

Per-task budget: 4,000 tokens.
Per-session budget: 30,000 tokens.
If a task is approaching budget, summarize and start fresh. Do not push through.
Surfacing the breach > silently overrunning.

## 7. Surface conflicts, don't average them

If two existing patterns in the codebase contradict, don't blend them.
Pick one (the more recent / more tested), explain why, and flag the other for cleanup.
"Average" code that satisfies both rules is the worst code.

## 8. Read before you write

Before adding code in a file, read the file's exports, the immediate caller, and any obvious shared utilities.
If you don't understand why existing code is structured the way it is, ask before adding to it.
"Looks orthogonal to me" is the most dangerous phrase in this codebase.

## 9. Tests verify intent, not just behavior

Every test must encode WHY the behavior matters, not just WHAT it does.
A test like `expect(getUserName()).toBe('John')` is worthless if the function takes a hardcoded ID.
If you can't write a test that would fail when business logic changes, the function is wrong.

## 10. Checkpoint after every significant step

After completing each step in a multi-step task: summarize what was done, what's verified, what's left.
Don't continue from a state you can't describe back to me.
If you lose track, stop and restate.

## 11. Match the codebase's conventions, even if you disagree

If the codebase uses snake_case and you'd prefer camelCase: snake_case.
If the codebase uses class-based components and you'd prefer hooks: class-based.
Disagreement is a separate conversation. Inside the codebase, conformance > taste.
If you genuinely think the convention is harmful, surface it. Don't fork it silently.

## 12. Fail loud

If you can't be sure something worked, say so explicitly.
"Migration completed" is wrong if 30 records were skipped silently.
"Tests pass" is wrong if you skipped any.
"Feature works" is wrong if you didn't verify the edge case I asked about.
Default to surfacing uncertainty, not hiding it.

<!--END Kaparthy Rules-->

Tests are colocated with source.
Follow TDD principles. Before writing code, attempt to write a test that encapsulates the change — ensure the test fails (red), and after implementation the test passes (green). This is Test-Driven Development: red to green testing.

<!--CAVEMAN SPEC START-->

# Spec Writing Convention: Caveman Micro

Specs in this repo are contracts. Reduce ambiguity. Write specs in caveman style.

## Rules

- Drop articles (a, an, the), filler (just, really, basically, actually).
- Drop pleasantries (sure, certainly, happy to).
- No hedging. Fragments fine. Short synonyms.
- Technical terms stay exact. Code blocks unchanged.
- Pattern: [thing] [action] [reason]. [next step].

## Why

Caveman removes interpretation slack. "The system should probably validate the RT field" → "System validates RT field. Negative RT allowed." Less words, less ambiguity, stronger contract.

## Where

Applies to spec documents in `docs/specs/`. Does not apply to code comments, commit messages, or casual conversation.

<!--CAVEMAN SPEC END-->

<!--DEPENDENCY PROTOCOL START-->

# Dependency Protocol

Rules for managing dependencies. Reduces lockfile churn and CI surprises.

## Rules

- Add packages via `vp add <name>`. Never edit `package.json` or `pnpm-lock.yaml` by hand.
- After ANY rebase: run `vp install` before pushing. No exceptions.
- CI fails with module-not-found? Run `vp install` locally first. Lockfile likely out of sync. Do NOT add the missing package to `package.json` — the lockfile needs regeneration, not a new dependency.
- If a peer dependency is missing: use `vp add <name>`, not a manual `package.json` edit.
- Verify claims about CI behavior by reading `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. Never assume what CI does — read the config.
- Commit `pnpm-lock.yaml` alongside any dependency change.

## Why

Hand-editing package.json produces lockfile inconsistencies that pass local checks but fail CI. `vp add` keeps both files consistent.
